# Photo Sort And Sift

Photo Sort And Sift is a desktop application that allows users to select a folder of images, view them within the app, group related photos, delete photos, append metadata (tags, iNaturalist URL),and move selected photos to a seperate "Keepers" folder at the end of a flow.

Photo Sort And Sift is boilerplated from [Electron React Boilerplate](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate) using [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/), [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [React Router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router), [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), and [React Fast Refresh](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-refresh).
